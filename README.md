# Energy Saver: Your Personal Energy Consumption Guide

Energy wastage is a significant issue in today's world, with buildings and their appliances being major contributors. This not only impacts the environment but also leads to high electricity bills. Our solution, Energy Saver, is a web application that brings awareness to this issue by providing an AI analysis of the energy usage profile of home appliances.

By scanning pictures of appliances, users can understand the energy and monetary cost of their usage. This awareness encourages changes in appliance usage, leading to energy conservation. The application uses a state-of-the-art multimodal Large Language Model (GPT-4 Turbo with Vision) for analysis and provides usage tips and energy-efficient alternatives.

Some Technical features include:
- **Multimodal LLM**: Energy Saver uses one of the best current multimodal Large Language Models (GPT-4 Turbo with Vision), integrating image and text modalities.
